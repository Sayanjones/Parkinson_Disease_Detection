# Parkinson's Disease Detection 

## ABSTRACT:

Utilizing voice-based markers can aid in identifying symptoms related to conditions like Parkinson's disease, a contemporary neurodegenerative disorder impacting around 7 million individuals globally, primarily adults. Annually, approximately 150 thousand new clinical diagnoses are conducted. Traditionally, the detection of Parkinson's disease has posed challenges, often pinpointing only select symptoms while overlooking others, depending on individual criteria. As the manifestation of motor impairments signifies the illness, this indicator can serve as a method for detecting and diagnosing Parkinson's disease. Conventional wisdom has led medical professionals to predominantly concentrate on specific symptoms tied to Parkinson's disease, potentially neglecting other crucial aspects. Through the utilization of distinct assessment scales, this indicator can be employed effectively for disease identification and diagnosis. This initiative provides substantial evidence supporting the use of supervised categorization, which proves valuable for diagnosing individuals with ailments such as diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis. Leveraging Support Vector Machine and Hypermetric Tuning, a remarkable accuracy of 94.91% was achieved when diagnosing pathological conditions.  

## INTRODUCTION:

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the midbrain, resulting in various symptoms such as communication difficulties, voice changes, and abnormalities in movement. Individuals with PD often experience dysarthria, a condition marked by muscle weakness, paralysis, and impaired coordination affecting breathing, speech, crying, and intonation. While the exact cause of Parkinson's remains unknown, research suggests a complex interplay of genetic, biological, and environmental factors contributing to the diversity of symptoms and the disease's progression over time. This inherent variability poses challenges for clinical trials seeking effective treatment endpoints and uncertainties regarding patients' quality of life. Recent studies have also highlighted alterations in the peripheral immune system of PD patients, with emerging evidence implicating the protein Î±-synuclein, the enteric nervous system, and the gut-brain axis in the disease's development, hinting that Parkinson's may originate from peripheral sources. Identifying biomarkers that can predict PD progression is critical, given the variability in symptoms and disease trajectory, which can evolve over decades. Therefore, the development of more refined diagnostic tools is imperative to address the evolving symptomatology associated with PD. Speech impairments in PD are characterized by diminished volume, changes in pitch and quality, decreased articulation clarity, slow speech rate, variable loudness, indistinct consonants, and a hoarse voice (dysphonia). Given the diverse voice-related symptoms, leveraging voice analysis through non-invasive methods like mobile devices, in conjunction with Vector Support Machines and Hypermetric Tuning, holds promise for improved PD detection.
